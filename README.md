# modular-iot-sensor-node
Modular IoT node with solar-powered LiPo battery, ESP32, and environmental sensors
 Modular IoT Sensor Node  
**Solar-Powered | ESP32-Based | Environmental Monitoring**

This is a personal hardware design project aimed at building a compact, solar-powered, low-power IoT node for environmental sensing. Designed in **Altium Designer**, the node is modular, field-deployable, and built around the ESP32, capable of running on solar energy with LiPo battery backup.

## Project Goals

- âœ… Build a **professional-grade PCB** in Altium Designer
- âœ… Learn to design for **low-power and renewable energy use**
- âœ… Enable modular plug-and-play **sensor support (IÂ²C)**
- âœ… Document the project thoroughly for my **portfolio & GitHub**

## Power Architecture

The device uses a hybrid power design:
- **Solar charging** via CN3065
- **USB charging & protection** via TP4056
- **3.7V LiPo battery** with 3.3V LDO regulation (AP2112K)
- Battery voltage monitored via ADC
- Designed for **deep sleep** to extend runtime

## What I'm Learning

This project is part of my self-driven learning path to become a better hardware engineer. Through it, I'm gaining hands-on experience in:

- LiPo charging and protection circuits
- Efficient power rail design
- Sensor interfacing and PCB routing
- Sleep modes and power budgeting
- Documenting real-world hardware projects
